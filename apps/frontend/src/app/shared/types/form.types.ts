 * Form Style Variants
 *
 * - 'modern': iOS-inspired style with fixed 40px height, 0.75rem border-radius,
 *   uppercase labels with letter-spacing. This is the default for all form components.
 *
 * - 'classic': Traditional style based on size prop (sm/md/lg heights),
 *   standard labels. Use this when you need the previous styling behavior.
